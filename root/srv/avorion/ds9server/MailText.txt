Hello There!

Welcome to the DeepSpace 9.875 server!

First off, we recommend that you join our Discord, as our community is quite active there and we post updates on what we're working on rather frequently. You also have a vote in where this server takes us in our polls channel, where we'll occasionally query the community for their thoughts on if/how we should implement various things on our server. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! We have a pretty friendly community overall, and we'd like to keep it that way. On that note, as far as rules go, we have the following:

1. Be kind.
2. Be respectful.
3. Keep heated arguments to DMs (they *do* happen, we understand)
4. Have fun!

And on that last note, we've included some beginning resources to get you going :)
